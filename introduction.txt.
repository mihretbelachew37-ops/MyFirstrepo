Brief Introduction About Myself
My name is Mihret Belachew, and I am a third-year Accounting and Finance student. Alongside my studies, I have practical experience in data analysis and stakeholder research, which has helped me connect classroom knowledge with real-world applications. I am passionate about amplifying rural voices in Ethiopian education and applying statistical concepts to solve meaningful challenges.
Looking ahead, I aspire to grow as a leader who empowers communities and drives positive change. I believe leadership is not just about guiding others, but about building culture, collaboration, and accountability. My goal is to use my skills in finance, communication, and research to create impact both locally and globally.
